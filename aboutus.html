            <div class="section-header text-center">
                <h2>Why Learn Arabic? </h2>
            </div>
            <p>Arabic is the official language of 26 countries, spanning a vast region that includes the Middle East and
                North Africa. It is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Understanding Arabic
                allows you to engage with one of the most historically and culturally rich regions of the world. Whether
                you’re interested in literature, history, religion, business, or politics, a solid grasp of Arabic can
                be incredibly beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>

                Furthermore, the demand for Arabic speakers is growing globally. In fields such as international
                relations, global trade, journalism, and intelligence, Arabic language proficiency is increasingly seen
                as a valuable asset. By learning Arabic, you’re not just acquiring a new skill—you’re opening doors to
                new career opportunities and global connections.</p>
